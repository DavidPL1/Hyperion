## [UNRELEASED] 

### Added
- This changelog
- Graph generated by visual validator mode now clusters by hostname
- Reusing still alive slave sockets after a disconnect on a reconnect attempt (see #30).
- Host status dictionary to keep track of each hosts status (DISCONNECTED, SSH_ONLY and CONNECTED)

### Changed
- Slave session start moved from ssh window of the master server tmux session to remote host tmux session called 
CONFIG_NAME-slave (standard session components get started in too). This way the terminal instance running the slave
can be accessed on the remote host, which is more practical.

### Fixed
- Stability of execute mode (all commands now work again for remote or local components)
- validator mode: moved setting component ids to a function that is called before analysing the config so that it now
is able to find the id key each component dict.
- visual validator mode
- Trying to send commands to not connected slaves
- Set ssh connect option batchmode to disable being prompted for a password, when auth via ssh keys is not successful, 
because the tmux window would be kept busy and the application would loop endlessly waiting for the ssh process to 
finish.
- On slave disconnect pass host name instead of the ip to the disconnect event (caused additional host entries 
in host_list see #29)
