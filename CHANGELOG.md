## [UNRELEASED] 

### Added
- This changelog
- Graph generated by visual validator mode now clusters by hostname
- Reusing still alive slave sockets after a disconnect on a reconnect attempt (see #30).
- Host status dictionary to keep track of each hosts status (DISCONNECTED, SSH_ONLY and CONNECTED)
- All socket connections are routed over SSH port forwarding (using the control master so every host connection uses
only one port again). Implicitly adds user authentication for UI clients and remote slaves and encrypts the 
communication thus resolving #32 and #28.
  - `forward_over_ssh()` forwards a random local port to the remote server port using the custom ssh config. On success
  the random port is returned to be used .
  - To identify slaves each slave sends an `auth` message containing its hostname on connect because the management
  server gets local sockets without information which remote host the come from. The port of the connection is then 
  mapped to the host from the message payload.
- Possibility to use environment variables for host names in components (e.g `host: ${base-pc}` where base-pc can 
evaluate to anything)

### Changed
- Slave session start moved from ssh window of the master server tmux session to remote host tmux session called 
CONFIG_NAME-slave (standard session components get started in too). This way the terminal instance running the slave
can be accessed on the remote host, which is more practical.
- Moved `setup_ssh_config()` method to a static context so that it can be run without having a reference to a manager
AbstractManager instance.
- Socket servers are now always bound to loopback to make connections inaccessible from other network devices forcing 
clients to use ssh forwarding.
- Moved localhost checks in RemoteClientInterfaces to the BaseClient class.
- Renamed `set_component_ids` to `conf_preprocessing` and added resolving hosts that are given as env variables. For
the sake of using variables defined in the custom environment file (if any is given) it is sourced via subprocess and 
the env variables are analyzed.
- Only broadcast local check events or if a slave did not answer (in time) to prevent sending a check event twice 
(received check events are forwarded automatically)

### Fixed
- Stability of execute mode (all commands now work again for remote or local components)
- validator mode: moved setting component ids to a function that is called before analysing the config so that it now
is able to find the id key each component dict.
- visual validator mode
- Trying to send commands to not connected slaves
- Set ssh connect option batchmode to disable being prompted for a password, when auth via ssh keys is not successful, 
because the tmux window would be kept busy and the application would loop endlessly waiting for the ssh process to 
finish.
- On slave disconnect pass host name instead of the ip to the disconnect event (caused additional host entries 
in host_list see #29)
- Add a check if ssh is actually running instead of checking if only the window exists before attempting a slave start.
That would cause an incorrect status of SSH_ONLY when the slave connection failed instead of DISCONNECTED as it should
be.
- SlaveManager check_buffer content validation: changed to None check instead of single if because a value of 0 as
answer (currently RUNNING) would be interpreted as no answer and result in an UNREACHABLE event.
